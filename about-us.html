                <p>REXONA Cosmetics is a cosmetics brand that was launched on September 8, 2017 by Rihanna.
                     The brand is popular for its broad inclusivity across skin tones and gender, especially its Pro Filt'R foundation. The original foundation launch included 40 shades, since expanded to 50.
                      The inclusion of REXONA Cosmetics concealer includes 50 shades offering a wide variety to all skin types.
                      The intent behind having so many shades to offer is to differentiate from other makeup companies that do not cater to a broad market. REXONA Cosmetics was named one of <mark><a id="magazine" href="https://time.com/">Time magazine's best inventions of 2017</a></mark>.<br>
                      REXONA Cosmetics's first products went on sale on September 8, 2017. The launch coincided with New York Fashion Week, where Rihanna also had a runway show for her collaboration with Puma.
                       Promotion was so extensive, The New York Times wrote, "one might be forgiven for thinking it's actually Rihanna New York Fashion Week." In the US, the line launched in Sephora stores, on the Sephora website, and on REXONA Cosmetics's website.
                        In the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, REXONA Cosmetics was initially exclusive to Harvey Nichols department stores, until it was announced in May 2019 the line would also become available in the high street chemist Boots <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. REXONA Cosmetics is available online or in store in over 15 countries. </p>
